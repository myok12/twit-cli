`version: 0.0.1`

> Note: This is the first version of `twit-cli` (duh), so at the moment you can only send tweets. Over the next coming weeks, many new features will be added. This means versions will be updated rapidly. Each new feature will be an uptick. So ready your `npm update` command! On with the `README`...

# Intro
Do you love running applications from the command line? Do you love doing everything with your keyboard? I sure do! If you don't then this tool probably isn't for you. The `twit-cli` tool features all the great things you like to do on twitter, but in the comfort, love, and safety of your terminal.

## Requirements
- [`node js`](http://nodejs.org)
- [`npm`](http://npmjs.org)
- A twitter api account
- A love for the terminal and cli tools

## Getting started
### Install
`npm install twit-cli -g --production`

> Omit the `--production` flag if you would like to run tests.

### Configuration
Create a `.twit-cli` dot file in your **home** directory with the following values that correspond to your Twitter application account. If you haven't created one yet, create it **[here](https://dev.twitter.com/apps)**. In order for `twit-cli` to work, you must set the application to **read, write, and direct messages**. Without that setting, `twit-cli` will fail to work and you will have to using Twitter from some application that is obviously inferior to cli.

#### Example:

```
{
	"consumer_key": "KEYZZZ",
	"consumer_secret": "SECRETZZZ",
	"access_token": "SECRET_KEYZZZZ",
	"access_token_secret": "SECRET_TOKENZZZ"
}
```

## Purpose
I created `twit-cli` mostly as an exercise to create a `node.js` cli tool, but also so I could tweet while in my terminal, because who doesn't want to do everything from the CLI.
